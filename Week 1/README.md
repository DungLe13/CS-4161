## Week 1 Journal
**In-class excercises**

1. I worked with Yufei Lin
2. a. Both of us want a letter grade 
    b. 7 
    c. weekly basis
    d. one final project
    e. The attendance policy: You should come to the class being ready to discuss the materials. Negotiate in advance for absences; need to fulfill a lot of assignment in class.
    f. Due dates and alternative deliverables are negotiable before the deadline.
    g. JavaScript, Processing Java, Android Java, Swift, Python
    h. No
    j. A product is the final result of a process, usually it is significant in size. Practices are what you do on a frequent basis to get to the project.
3. What are the criteria for the final project to be considered large and significant?
4. Fairly easy

**An idea for final project assignment:**

Lip reading (or Audio Visual Recognition) has been considered as a solution for speech recognition tasks when the audio is corrupted or when there are many noises in the background. It is also used as an assistant feature for people who experienced hearing-impair/deafness. However, the task is considered very difficult, mostly because there are more visemes than phonemes, or sometimes, one viseme can be interpreted as multiple phonemes. With this being said, I wanted to build an automated lip reading system that can be used to help people with difficulty in hearing. (In the end, I also want to deploy the system as part of a mobile application; however, at the moment, my vision of how this system can be integrated in a stand-alone mobile product is quite vague.)

**Revised Assignment for Tutorial:**

(1) In general, I think I understood most of the concepts introduced in these HTML files. In the uploaded section, I attached two HTML files (since the files of group 2,3,4 are very similar to that of group 1) that was carefully formatted and annotated with comments on each function.

(2) List of Concepts that I already know:

* All the basic HTML codes (how to create header, paragraph, inputs, button, etc.)
* Most of the basic JavaScript code (to interact with HTML input using getElementById, to create functions and declare variables in JavaScript)
* Most of the map-related JavaScript code (how to call google map API and how to set up marker and popups/info window)

List of Concepts that I need to learn more:

* I was caught off-guard when seeing the createElement and createTextNode at first. However, I am good with it now (these properties are for creating HTML elements that did not appear in the map in the first place.)

(3) Since the webpages are somewhat similar, I only commented on the code of the first two files. In general, these codes are not intimidating for me at all, yet, as noted in the file itself, these code can be made better (especially with the JavaScript part.)
     The object-oriented approach in JavaScript will be completed in the second week.
