## Week 5 Journal

For this week NLP-sampler, I continued working on a project that I started during my fourth term, namely *Literature Mixing Machine*. 

**Project Description**

Literature Mixing Machine is a web-based project built on the idea of mixing sentences from different classic literature excerpts to create a new excerpt that inherites styles and tones from original ones. As an user, you are allowed to select the author or insert the excerpts of your choice. The machine will break these excerpts into individual sentences before randomly select and reorder these sentences into new excerpt.

This project is very much inline with what we learned about Natural Language Processing in class and this week's assignment. Unfortunately, I did not use p5.js for this project, but instead purely JavaScript, since it has many built-in functions for string manipulation. The online version of this project can be found at http://student2.bennington.edu/~dungle/Final-Site/final.html)

**ELIZA**

Another project that I included in this week's asignment is a simple version of ELIZA - an early natural language processing computer program that acted as a real-life psychologist. The program is written in Prolog (if you don't have Prolog compiler, you can compile the program online @ https://swish.swi-prolog.org/). The code for ELIZA program can be found at my another GitHub repository (https://github.com/DungLe13/Eliza-1.0)
