## Week 7 Journal

Since my final project will contain an element related to reinforcement learning, I have spent this week's assignment following a tutorial online and learning to apply some reinforcement learning technique. In 2014, a tech start-up named DeepMind (now Goolge DeepMind) published a paper that introduced an RL method called *Deep Q-network*. 

This code is an attempt to learn about Deep Q-network, and how it can be utilized in my final project.
